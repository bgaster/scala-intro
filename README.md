Introduction to Scala
=====================

Scala is a modern progrmaming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine
 (JVM) and thus can run (almost) anywhere. It offers access to two popular 
programming paradiams, functional and object-oriented and so has received
prase from fans of both models.

This repo contains, an in development, introduction to programming course 
based around Scala. It is intended for readers with little or no programming
experience, unlike much of the current Scala material out there, and can be
used for those interested specificly in Scala development or more generally
those wanting to make head roads into the exciting world of programming.
