Some GADT Examples in Scala
============================

Of course, many will argue these are in fact inductive familes
and clearly Haskell's GADTs came later but as I started there for
this particular exercise I'll stick with it...

This less of a sample and more of a collection of examples using GADTs.
I found it useful to write these while developing a basic understanding of GADTs
in Scala, rather than Haskell or Agda. It was a pain working out how to get
type refinement to work but with some help from the internet it became clear that it was 
managable in Scala, although a long way from the simplicity of Agda.

Anyway, I'm putting these up in case someone else finds them useful.
